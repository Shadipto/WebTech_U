        >This is the second paragraph in the lab task 1. String interpolation is
        a powerful feature in many programming languages that allows you to
        embed expressions or variables directly within a string.</mark

      It provides a convenient way to create dynamic and formatted strings
      without the need for complex concatenation. In languages that support
      string interpolation, you can include placeholders within a string, and
      these placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding values at
      runtime.<br />
      <strong>Strong full power.</strong>
      This makes it easier to construct strings that include variable data, such
      as user input, calculations, or any other dynamic content. String
      interpolation enhances code readability and maintainability by reducing
      the need for manual string concatenation and making it clear where
      variables are being inserted into the string.<br />
